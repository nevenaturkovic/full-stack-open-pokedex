### According to Google and Wikipedia:

- Pylint is a Python static code analysis tool which looks for programming errors, helps enforcing a coding standard, sniffs for code smells and offers simple refactoring suggestions. Pytest is generally the easiest and most Pythonic way to test your code. Travis-CI is a CI service that is very well designed, free for open source projects, and easy to learn how to use while still having a high ceiling of potential customization.

- Some of the alternatives are: CircleCI, **GitLab CI** (Git repository control - When you use GitLab CI/CD, you get total control over the branches and other facets when controlling Git repositories to protect your code from threats. Application performance monitoring - This feature isn’t available in Jenkins. You can check basic information about the deployed code or project on the server but not the overall performance. Expect changed set support and a simple procedure for installation and configuration. Code quality - You’ll have to download the Sonarqube or a similar plugin to check code quality on Jenkins. Setting a self-defined quality gate for your project is also possible.), Atlassian Bamboo, JetBrains TeamCity, Buildkite. GitLab would be my personal preference.

- GitLab's application offers functionality to collaboratively plan, build, secure, and deploy software as a complete DevOps Platform. GitLab is scalable and can be hosted on-premises or on cloud storage. It also includes a wiki, issue-tracking, IDE, and CI/CD pipeline features. GitLab, like GitHub, also offers a free GitLab Pages product for hosting static webpages, with optional Let's Encrypt for HTTPS support.
